A quantum computer, conversely, uses quantum mechanics to perform computation. Rather than bits and logic gates, quantum computers use qubits and quantum gates.</p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRRhhsTPSDsfiM-gl87kTjR-_fwH7I7UhJwR7HVMZM4LG-9qHu5&usqp=CAU"><p> Hmm doesn't it sound amazing.Let’s start with <strong>what</strong> a qubit is. A qubit is a vector of two complex numbers with unit length.For starters, a bit is either a 0 or 1. There are no probabilities here, it’s either known to be a 0 or it’s known to be a 1. A qubit, conversely, is inherently probabilistic, meaning that two <strong>identical</strong> qubits may have <strong>different </strong>values once measured.</p><h5> Qubit Control</h5><p> Computer scientists control the microscopic particles that act as qubits in quantum computers by using<strong> control devices</strong>.<li><strong>Ion traps </strong>use optical or magnetic fields (or a combination of both) to trap ions.</li><li><strong>Optical traps</strong> use light waves to trap and control particles.</li><li><strong>Quantum dots</strong> are made of semiconductor material and are used to contain and manipulate electrons.</li><li><strong>Semiconductor impurities</strong> contain electrons by using "unwanted" atoms found in semiconductor material.</li><li><strong>Superconducting circuits </strong>allow electrons to flow with almost no resistance at very low temperatures.</li></p><h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>Quantum computers could one day replace silicon chips, just like the transistor once replaced the vacuum tube. But for now, the technology required to develop such a quantum computer is beyond our reach. Most research in quantum computing is still very theoretical. One day we might be harvesting the power of quantum computing in finding solutions for problems in domains like Encryption and Cybersecurity,Classical Computing Problems,drug and research development ,financial services,supply chain logistics.</p><h4 id="more">Want to know more ?</h4><iframe data-autoresize="false" class="wakeletEmbed" width="100%" height="2000px" src="https://embed.wakelet.com/wakes/0fa4a815-51e3-40b9-aba0-60f562081329/list?hide-cover=1&hide-description=1&hide-title=1" style="border: none" allow="autoplay"></iframe> <script src="https://embed-assets.wakelet.com/wakelet-embed.js" charset="UTF-8"></script> </div><div class="col-sm"></div></div></div></div> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-J6qa4849blE2+poT4WnyKhv5vZF5SrPo0iEjwBvKU7imGFAV0wwj1yYfoRSJoZ+n" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-Q6E9RHvbIyZFJoft+2mJbHaEWldlvI9IOYy5n3zV9zzTtmI3UksdQRVvoxMfooAo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-wfSDF2E50Y2D1uUdj0O3uMBJnjuUD4Ih7YwaYd1iqfktj0Uod8GCExl3Og8ifwB6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> </body></html>
